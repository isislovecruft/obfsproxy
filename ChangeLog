Changes in version 0.2.5 - UNRELEASED
 - Use gmpy's modular exponentiation function since it's more efficient.
   Fixes #10031 and adds gmpy as a dependency. Patch by Philipp Winter.
 - Add a transport method called setup() that gets called on obfsproxy
   startup and can be used by transports for expensive initializations.
   Patch by David Stainton.
 - Add a transport method called get_public_server_options() that allows
   transports to filter server-side options that should not be announced
   to BridgeDB (because they might leak filesystem paths etc.) .
   Patch by David Stainton. Fixes #10243.
 - Make the circuit an attribute of the transport, rather than passing it
   as a method argument. Patch by Ximin Luo. Fixes #10342.
 - Rename the handshake() method to circuitConnected().
   Patch by Ximin Luo.


Changes in version 0.2.4 - 2013-09-30
 - Make pluggable transports aware of where they should store state
   in the filesystem. Also introduce --data-dir CLI switch to specify
   the path in external mode. Fixes #9815. Patch by Philipp Winter.
 - Pass server-side parameters (like shared-secrets) from Tor to the
   transports. Fixes #8979.


Changes in version 0.2.3 - 2013-09-11
 - Use the new pyptlib API (>= pyptlib-0.0.4). Patch by Ximin Luo.
 - Add support for sending the pluggable transport name to Tor (using
   the Extended ORPort) so that it can be considered in the statistics.
 - Remove licenses of dependencies from the LICENSE file. (They were
   moved to be with browser bundle packaging scripts.)
 - Fix a bug in the SOCKS code. An assertion would trigger if
   the SOCKS destination sent traffic before obfsproxy did.
   Fixes #9239.
 - Add a --version switch. Fixes #9255.


Changes in version 0.2.2 - 2013-04-15
 - Fix a bug where the CLI compatibility patch that was introduced
   in 0.2.1 was placed in the wrong place, making it useless when
   obfsproxy gets installed. Patch by Lunar.
 - Add dependencies to the setup script.
 - Update the HOWTO to use pip.


Changes in version 0.2.1 - 2013-04-08
