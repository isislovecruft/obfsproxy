 - Add txsocksx and parsley as dependencies in py2exe. Fixes bug #12381.


Changes in version 0.2.11 - 2014-07-16:
 - Write a 'server_password' file with the scramblesuit password to
   make it easier for bridge operators to find their password. Patch
   by Philipp Winter. Fixes #10887.
 - Add --password-file switch for providing scramblesuit passwords.
   Patch by irregulator. Fixes #8040.
 - Fix bug to prevent denial-of-service attacks targeting the
   authentication mechanism.  Fixes #11092. The problem was pointed
   out by Yawning Angel.

 - Improve scramblesuit spec and fix several issues. Fixes bug #10893.
   Thanks to Yawning Angel.
 - Improve scramblesuit's packet morphing algorithm. Fixes bug #10991.
   Thanks to Yawning Angel.
 - When in external mode, only call the setup() method of the
   transport we are going to launch, not of all transports.


Changes in version 0.2.10 - 2014-06-05:
 - Don't set the transport's circuit to None if we are closing
   a circuit; it was causing problems in obfs3. Fixes #11820.
 - Make sure that we don't try to do networking operations on a
   connection that should be closed. Fixes #11769.
 - Only print ScrambleSuit disclaimer on startup (instead of
   printing it for every connection). Fixes #11768.
 - Log the pyptlib version in startup. Patch by John Giannelos. Fixes #9878.


Changes in version 0.2.9 - 2014-05-01:
 - Support connecting over a HTTPS CONNECT proxy.  Patch by Yawning Angel.
   Fixes #11409.
 - Support connecting over SOCKS4(a) and SOCKS5.  Based on the patch by
   Arturo Filastò with changes by Yawning Angel.  Fixes #8956.
 - Fix the shebang of the obfsproxy executable so that it
   explicitly picks python2.  Makes obfsproxy work in platforms like
   Linux Arch where python3 is the default.  Fixes part of #11190.
   Patch by Yawning Angel.
 - The AES-CTR counter of obfs2 and obfs3 now wraps around to 0.
   Since, the counter value was derived from the protocol, there
   was an unlikely chance that PyCrypto would raise an OverflowError
   exception. Spotted by Yawning Angel. Fixes #11611.


Changes in version 0.2.8 - 2014-03-28:
 - Fix a bug in the SOCKS5 sever code.  An exception would be raised on systems
   with Python < 2.7.4.  Patch by Yawning Angel.  Fixes #11329.
 - Obfsproxy can now resolve bridge addresses that were provided as
   DNS hostnames.  Fix suggested by Yawning Angel. Resolves #10316.


Changes in version 0.2.7 - 2014-03-15
 - Support SOCKS5 instead of SOCKS4. Patch by Yawning Angel. Fixes #9221.
 - Fix a scramblesuit bug that makes bridges reject a session
   ticket connection from already seen clients. Diagnosed and patched
   by Yawning Angel. Fixes #11100.
 - obfs3 now uses twisted.internet.threads.deferToThread to process
   the key exchange outside of the main event loop.
   Patch by Yawning Angel. Fixes #11015.
 - Support gmpy2 if it is available in addition to gmpy.
   Patch by Yawning Angel.


Changes in version 0.2.6 - 2014-02-03
 - Stop having 'gmpy' as a hard dependency by removing it from setup.py.
   Now gmpy is only used if it was already installed on the system.


Changes in version 0.2.5 - 2014-02-03
 - Use gmpy's modular exponentiation function since it's more efficient.
   Fixes #10031 and adds gmpy as a dependency. Patch by Philipp Winter.
 - Add a transport method called setup() that gets called on obfsproxy
   startup and can be used by transports for expensive initializations.
   Patch by David Stainton.
 - Add a transport method called get_public_server_options() that allows
   transports to filter server-side options that should not be announced
   to BridgeDB (because they might leak filesystem paths etc.) .
   Patch by David Stainton. Fixes #10243.
 - Make the circuit an attribute of the transport, rather than passing it
   as a method argument. Patch by Ximin Luo. Fixes #10342.
 - Rename the handshake() method to circuitConnected().
   Patch by Ximin Luo.
 - Add ScrambleSuit as transport protocol. Fixes #10598.


Changes in version 0.2.4 - 2013-09-30
 - Make pluggable transports aware of where they should store state
   in the filesystem. Also introduce --data-dir CLI switch to specify
   the path in external mode. Fixes #9815. Patch by Philipp Winter.
 - Pass server-side parameters (like shared-secrets) from Tor to the
   transports. Fixes #8979.


Changes in version 0.2.3 - 2013-09-11
 - Use the new pyptlib API (>= pyptlib-0.0.4). Patch by Ximin Luo.
 - Add support for sending the pluggable transport name to Tor (using
   the Extended ORPort) so that it can be considered in the statistics.
 - Remove licenses of dependencies from the LICENSE file. (They were
   moved to be with browser bundle packaging scripts.)
 - Fix a bug in the SOCKS code. An assertion would trigger if
   the SOCKS destination sent traffic before obfsproxy did.
   Fixes #9239.
 - Add a --version switch. Fixes #9255.


Changes in version 0.2.2 - 2013-04-15
 - Fix a bug where the CLI compatibility patch that was introduced
   in 0.2.1 was placed in the wrong place, making it useless when
   obfsproxy gets installed. Patch by Lunar.
 - Add dependencies to the setup script.
 - Update the HOWTO to use pip.


Changes in version 0.2.1 - 2013-04-08
 - Rename project from "pyobfsproxy" to "obfsproxy"!
 - Add licenses of dependencies to the LICENSE file.
 - Add support for logging exceptions to logfiles.
 - Add shared secret support to obfs2.
 - Add support for per-connection SOCKS arguments.
 - Add a setup script for py2exe.
 - Slightly improve the executable script.
 - Improve command line interface compatibility between C-obfpsroxy
   and Python-obfsproxy by supporting the "--managed" switch.


Changes in version 0.0.2 - 2013-02-17
 - Add some more files to the MANIFEST.in.


Changes in version 0.0.1 - 2013-02-15
 - Initial release.
